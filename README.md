# trojan on Doprax
you should use the client supporting trojan, like v2rayNG、Matsuri on Android, shadowsocket on ios, v2rayN on windows and so on. Clash is advised because v2rayNG and Matsuri can not often be connected when visiting youtube and some other websites.

the trojan configuration on Matsuri is like the following image：

then you can get the trojan link by Matsuri and import to clash.
